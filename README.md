# Java-Collections-Framework
This project is to provide an easy-to-understand overview of Java Collections framework which is actively used by developers, interviewers, interviewees, and so on. I am not aiming to describe all classes which implement Java Collection Interface, but instead, tried to explain how representative classes work internally and how those mechanisms affect the time complexity. So, this project does not provide any source code but only provides a visual description of the Java Collections framework.
