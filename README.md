# Java-Collections-Framework
This project is to provide an easy-to-understand overview of Java Collections framework which is actively used by developers, interviewers, interviewees, and so on. I am not aiming to describe all classes which implement Java Collection Interface, but instead, tried to explain how representative classes work internally and how those mechanisms affect the time complexity.
